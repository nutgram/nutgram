/**
 * Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display a reply interface to the user
 * (act as if the user has selected the bot‘s message and tapped ’Reply').
 * This can be extremely useful if you want to create user-friendly
 * step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice {@see https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode privacy mode}.
 *
 * Example: A {@see https://t.me/PollBot poll bot} for groups
 * runs in {@see https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode privacy mode}
 * (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions).
 * There could be two ways to create a new poll:
 *
 * - Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2).
 * May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
 * - Guide the user through a step-by-step process.
 * ‘Please send me your question’, ‘Cool, now let’s add the first answer option‘, ’Great.
 * Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you‘re ready’.
 *
 * The last option is definitely more attractive.
 * And if you use {@see https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#forcereply ForceReply}
 * in your bot‘s questions, it will receive the user’s answers even
 * if it only receives replies, commands and mentions — without any extra work for the user.
 * @see https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#forcereply
